# Introduction

PixPilot is a library and collection of telemetry screens for radios running OpenTX >=2.2.

PixPilot comes as a package of telemetry screens and adapters.
The adapters parse telemetry information from various protocols and flight controllers.
The user can then select between various telemetry screens, which will work independent.

Support for PX4 is in work. See the [relevant pull request](https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/pull/4361).

Support for Arducopter will be added once they have implemented [the relevant PR](https://github.com/ArduPilot/ardupilot/issues/1587).

Thanks to ilihack, SockEye, Richardoe, Schicksie, lichtl, ben_&Jace25, Clooney82&fnoopdogg for their previous work.
